# Cargo
Cargo is a tool that will allow you to send files via "containers", an unique ID that each file gets that allows basically anonymous file transfer.
# Usage
Copy the contents of the repository and install the libs contained in requirements.txt. Create a secret.txt file, which will contain your SFTP credentials (<ip:port> on the first line, <user> on the second line and <password> on the third line).
